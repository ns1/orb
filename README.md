**Orb** is a new kind of observability platform that helps operators, developers, and end users understand their
networks, distributed applications, and traffic flows in real time.

It combines concepts from Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Compute, and high throughput stream processing to offer command
of a fleet of distributed agents which can be orchestrated in real time to summarize high volume, information dense data
streams down to lightweight, actionable data sets directly at the edge.

**Orb** gives you a precision instrument to collect just the observability data you are interested in, extracting the
needles from the haystack at the edge. It is based on the [pktvisor](https://github.com/ns1/pktvisor) observability
agent.

The platform is open source, extensible, vendor neutral, and cloud native.

**Orb** is a new project and just gathering speed. Star the project to show your interest!

We are very interested in hearing about your use cases, feature requests, and other feedback.
