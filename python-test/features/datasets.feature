      And the Orb user logs in
      And that an agent already exists and is online
      And referred agent is subscribed to a group
      And that a sink already exists
      And that a policy already exists
    When a new dataset is created using referred group, sink and policy ID
    Then the container logs should contain the message "managing agent policy from core" within 10 seconds
      And the container logs should contain the message "policy applied successfully" within 10 seconds
      And the container logs should contain the message "scraped metrics for policy" within 180 seconds
      And referred sink must have active state on response within 10 seconds
      And datasets related to all existing policies have validity valid
