## 🚢 Install Kind (Requirement)

Kind is a tool for running local k8s clusters using docker container as nodes.

If you have `go 1.17 or later` installed:
```shell
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.14.0
```

macOS users can also use `brew`:
```shell
brew install kind
```

> 🚨 **Windows WSL users**: WSL is also supported, but for some reason the Orb stack mess up the WSL internal DNS.
> You can fix that by editing your `/etc/wsl.conf` and adding the following:
> ```shell
> [network]
> generateResolvConf = false
> ```
> Restart WSL by executing the following on CMD:
> ```shell
> wsl --shutdown
> ```
> Open WSL terminal again and remove the symbolic link from `/etc/resolv.conf`:
> ```shell
> sudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf
> ```
> Create a new `/etc/resolv.conf` file and add the following:
> ```shell
> nameserver 8.8.8.8
> ```
> save the file and you are done.

## 🚀  Deploy Orb on Kind

Add `kubernetes.docker.internal` host as `127.0.0.1` address in your hosts file:
```shell
echo "127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
> 
Setup **Orb Charts** dependencies repositories:
```shell
make prepare-helm
```
> **💡 Note:** You just need to run those steps until here once, even if you delete the cluster afterwards.

Use the following command to create the cluster and deploy **Orb**:
```shell
make kind-create-all
```

Access the **Orb UI** by accessing: https://kubernetes.docker.internal/. The following users are created during the mainflux bootstrap:
E-mail | Password | Role
:--- | :--- | :---
admin@kind.com | pass123456 | Admin

Have fun! 🎉 When you are done, you can delete the cluster by running:
```shell
make kind-delete-cluster
```
